# TreeOfGold
TreeOfGold is written using the Unity platform in C# and is a 2D Turn-Based fantasy strategy game. Command your team of elite fighters and vanquish your foes to save the world from impending doom!

TreeOfGold began as a project to showcase, develop, and refine my ability to code a large project, utilizing design principles and architecture to make a scalable and multifaced application. It has grown to be a labor of love to not only dive deep into Unity and C# but also create what is hopefully an enjoyable and in-depth playing experience for players all over.

Features: TBD
