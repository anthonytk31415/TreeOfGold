- right now, you can move a char, wait, then move to a another area, and still select the unit to "do stuff". weird. 


** enemy phase
- trigger "enemy phase" banner
- build a queue for doing moves
- build a DoMove() method

** player phase
- reset moves and booleans


** overall game
- build win conditions
- how to handle death? do you remove it from the character array?




- update the mechanism of chararray? make it its own class with access properties to decouple?
