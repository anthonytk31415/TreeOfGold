Todo: 

Highlight mechanics
- consolidate into the unselectedState manager
- clicking on enemy unit in unselected phase shows enemies movement
- when moved, show trail of move


Battle
- add archer style attacks

** GameManager Updates: 
- update the mechanism of chararray? make it its own class with access properties to decouple? 

** MoveController
- redesign this into a state machine in conjunction with chooseState


** Data controller for characters, maps, etc.

** Phase Banner
- change banner priority to upper level for correct screening
- Enemy phase highlights; Screen


movement: 
- control movement to show characters moving from selected unmoved to moved
- when selected, "walk"



build special moves 
- sabin: healing, elemental, 
- terra: fire magic damage, sword damage, support
- celes, magic absorb, ice attack, ice mage
- shadow: mirror image, damage, utility

** to do important: 
- build other chars (locke, celes built)
- build and test attacking: 
    - player flash > attack > enemy flash; will need to adjust it as battles are based off of coroutines 
- adjust locke and other char's sword position
- after unselecting, resume to idleDown
- character cleanup: delete probably character animation controllers and animation clips
- when buildng other characters, standardize perhaps left and right images

Visuals
- lefthanded versus righthanded
